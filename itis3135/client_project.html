            <h1>Project Overview</h1>

            <h2>Describe your application and its purpose:</h2>
            <p>To sell products made by the company 2bsquareddesign.</p>

            <h2>Intended users of the website:</h2>
            <p>People interested in our products.</p>

            <h2>Overview of the content of the website:</h2>
            <p>Cakes, cookies, and t-shirts.</p>

            <h2>Client Information:</h2>
            <p>If for any reason you believe this material should not be published on the web - replace the information with something like [private]. This might make sense with email or phone or name, but NOT with the business/idea/concept- as these will be public this semester, one way or the other. If that's not possible, find another client.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Name of the client:</strong>Teri Oliver</li>
                <li><strong>Organization/Institute/Business the client/s are associated with:</strong>2bsquareddesign</li>
                <li><strong>Client's valid email address:</strong>2bsquareddesign@gmail.com</li>
                <li><strong>Client's phone number (if they are willing to share):</strong>NA</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Wireframe:</h2>
            <p>Using your UNCC google account, connect draw.io to your google drive, and using the built-in tools create a wireframe for the default page design for your project. Share the image and link to it from within the design doc page, and then embed it nicely with figure and figcaption.</p>
            <figure>
                <img src="stuff/Client Wire Frame.drawio.png" alt="wireframe">
                <figcaption>Wire Frame</figcaption>
            </figure>>

            <h2>Site Map:</h2>
            <p>Before you start coding, you need to understand what pages you will need to create and how you will navigate between them. Below is an example of a site map. Use Draw.io to create the sitemap. Share the image and link to it from within your design doc page, and then embed it nicely with figure and figcaption.</p>
            <figure>
                <img src="stuff/Client Project Part 1.drawio.png" alt="map">
                <figcaption>Mapping of Client Project</figcaption>
