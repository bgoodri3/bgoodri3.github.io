            <li>Submission took me to the generic Webpages.uncc.edu link, but had it very clear as to where to click to get to where I needed to go.</li>
            <li>Filing seems to be good.</li>
            <li>Design:<ol type="a">
                <li>Page is easy to read.</li>
                <li>Page uses good colors and fonts in a CSS file.</li>
                <li>CRAP: <ol type="i">
                    <li>Constrast: Colors are a bit dull, nothing seems to pop out, but I believe that is good for this scenario as aircrafts tend to use darker colors.</li>
                    <li>Repetition: The logo in the top left, the menu bar in the right, and the background image are repeated perfectly.</li>
                    <li>Alignment: All interfaces are aligned amazingly.</li>
                    <li>Proximity: All objects within the page are finely spaced from one another.</li>
                </ol></li>
            </ol></li>
            <li>The page has everything mentioned within it.</li>
            <li>Yes the header is within an H1 tag.</li>
            <li>Yes it starts with the name of the page.</li>
            <li>No slogan anywhere</li>
            <li>Yes it contains a proper footer.</li>
            <li>I believe that this website is well designed and meets the requirements.</li>
