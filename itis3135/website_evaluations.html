                <h3><a href="https://amisdubeauceron.org/">Amisdubeauceron</a></h3>
                <p>This website is a french website dedicated to Beauceron, a french herding dog. It has the following CRAP properties: </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Contrast: Contrast might be the only good thing about this webpage. Text is darker than the background it is on.</li>
                    <li>Repitition: While repitition is a good thing, there is definitely too much of it here. I love dogs, but even I think this is too many photos. Also the scrolling text doesn't change all that much.</li>
                    <li>Alignment: The alignment is decent, but the "Last Updated" box sitting in the bottom left corner sticks out like a sore thumb and ruins the website for me.</li>
                    <li>Proximity: Proximity isn't really displayed here as there isn't much that isn;t related to each other.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Ultimately I think this website needs to sit down and make it look better, especially if it was updated this year.</p>

                <h3><a href="https://www.starke-shopfitting.com/"">Starke-Shopfitting</a></h3>
                <p>This website is for a company similar to Target and Walmart, offering every day items as long as pharmaceuticals. It has the following CRAP properties: </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Contrast: All the wording is very clear to read, whether the background is dark or light colored and the text is the opposite. The images that the text is on could be contrasted a little but the text being in its own separate box helps out a lot.</li>
                    <li>Repition: All icons are in the smae format and the comapny name Starke is displayed many times but not too many.</li>
                    <li>Alignment: All proper sections are separated from one another but the content for each box is displayed perfectly evenly from one another.</li>
                    <li>Proximity: The proximity is fairly good for this website, the only issue is when you click the next button on the photo the text jumps around randomly which is a little confusing.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>This website has minor problems that could probably be fixed within a days work that I believe would make the website look slighty more professional.</p>
