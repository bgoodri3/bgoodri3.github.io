            <p>I am Brendon Goodrich. I am 22 years old and I am a nerd.</p>

            <h3>What is Dungeons and Dragons</h3>
            <p>Dungeon and Dragons is a tabletop roleplaying game, shortened to TTRPG, where you play mostly with your imagination. Run by a person commonly referred to as a Dungeon master, or DM for short, they guide the rest of the players through a narrative where the only limit is their imagination and some dice rolls.</p

        <section id="when">
            <h2>When can you play?</h2>
            <p>Harder than anything your DM can throw at you, scheduling is the bane of all players. Most groups wait for when everyone is free, and some play where their character might sit out for a session or two. Any D&D player will tell you this is the hardest part.</p>

        <section id="where">
            <h2>Where can you play?</h2>
            <p>Anywhere! You can play online, at a table, or even in a car. Sometimes you don't even need dice adn you just describe what happens. The fun can happen anywhere</p>

        <section id="why">
            <h2>Why do we play?</h2>
            <p>We play for a multitude of reasons. We play to tell a story. We play to talk to friends. We play because we want to explore dungeons and kill dragons. There is a multitude of reasons for people to play Dungeons and Dragons and to each their own. I play because I have fun with it. I can be a literal skeleton who wants to break out of their life long contract. I can be a bug person who screams in terror in every fight they're in. I can even be a sentient spoon if I wanted. It's just fun and way to relax after what feels like a long week.</p>
